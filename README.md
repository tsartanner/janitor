# Directory Janitor
A simple python script designed to clean and sort any directory that you provide the path to.

To change the pathway:

Change the path variable path = "C:\\Users\\XXXXXXX\\Downloads"
to whatever directory you choose to clean. The code is short and relatively easy to understand. 

Once the directory is defined, run the script and that's it!
